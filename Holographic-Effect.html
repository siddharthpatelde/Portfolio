		<h3>Holographic-Effect</h3>
		<h4>Situation</h4>
		<p>
			A friend from a local university asked for my help in a computer engineering project competition. They lacked experience in hardware and project development, so they reached out to me because of my expertise in Arduino. I agreed to assist, and they offered a grant of 50,000 INR (around $600) from the government for creating the prototype and scaling up the project. I took on the project for the valuable experience it offered.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h4>Task</h4>
		<p>My task was to create a compact Mars rover prototype equipped with 6 wheels, designed to effortlessly traverse 45-degree slopes. The rover needed wireless communication for remote operation and must include additional features to explore unknown environments. All of this had to be achieved within a strict budget of $600 and a time limit of 2 months, making it a challenging yet rewarding project.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h4>Action</h4>
		<p>First, I divided my actions into three main parts for the embedded system:</p>
		<ul>
		<p><li> 1.Features of the Rover: I designed this part using Arduino Mega and incorporated <b>5</b> essential features <b>- soil moisture detection, temperature sensing, gas detection, flame detection, and proximity sensing.</b></li></p>
		<p><li> 2.of the Rover: For this, I created a separate embedded system using 6 DC motors and a motor driver, ensuring smooth and precise movement for the rover.</li></p>
		<p><li> 3.Wireless Communication: To enable remote operation, I opted for the Bluetooth HC-05 module. This allowed me to control the rover conveniently from a mobile or tablet.</li></p>
	</ul>
		<p>By organizing the development process this way, I successfully integrated all the necessary functionalities into the small Mars rover prototype.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h4>Result</h4>
		<p>As a result, I successfully completed my part in the project. I designed the rover craft using PVC and handled all the paintwork personally. Additionally, I took full responsibility for creating the entire circuit on the PCB and wrote the code from scratch. The outcome was a remarkable rover prototype that not only got selected for a prestigious high-scale competition but also emerged victorious. The experience gained throughout this journey was truly invaluable, encompassing all the aspects I mentioned.</p>
